This is File Metadata Microservice, a back-end study project to practice using a node.js middleware `multer` to handle uploading file. It allows file uploading and temperary store file in folder `/tmp` and retrieves its information, specifically its size in bytes. Then, the page presents it within a JSON file.

To test it, all you need to do is to upload a random file and click `upload`. The site will redirect you to a black page with the file's size as JSON file.
